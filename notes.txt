* For TV series where the episodes are being added periodically (once a week/month etc) e.g. "Young Sheldon"; there should be an option to subscribe/follow the series such that whenever a new episode is added, we get a notification (either a push notification on the phone or a browser notification on the pc)

  version 1
    2 - DRU
    3 - DRU U LL DD
    4 - DRU U LL DD L UUU RRR
    5 - DRU U LL DD L UUU RRR U LLLL DDDD
    6 - DRU U LL DD L UUU RRR U LLLL DDDD L UUUUU RRRRR
    7 - DRU U LL DD L UUU RRR U LLLL DDDD L UUUUU RRRRR U LLLLLL DDDDDD
    8 - f(7) L U7 R7
    9 - f(8) U L8 D8
    f(2n) = f(2n-1) L U2n-1 R2n-1
    f(2n+1) = f(2n) U L2n D2n

    g(n) = |f(n)|
    g(2) = 3
    g(3) = g(2)+1+2*2 = 8
    g(4) = g(3)+1+2*3 = 15
    g(n) = g(n-1)+1+2*(n-1)
    g(n) = (n-1)^2-1+1+2*(n-1) = (n-1)^2 + 2*(n-1) + 1 - 1= n^2-1
